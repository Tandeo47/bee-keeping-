# Beekeeping/ Apiculture
is the maintenance of bee colonies, commonly in man-made hives, by humans. 
A beekeeper (apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces, such as beeswax, propolis, follower pollen, bee pollen, and royal jelly, and royal jelly, as well as to pollinate crops or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. 
A beehive is an enclosed structure in which some honey bee species of the subgenus Apis live and raise their young.
A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or “bee yard”.
# Importance of Beekeeping in Zambia
Beekeeping and honey hunting improve diets for an estimated250,000 farmers and are an important source of income for 20,000 rural households in Zambia. These activities are done during the time when labor demands for agriculture are low, thereby providing alternative employment for rural people.
The Beekeeping guide will be for a modern hive built for the soul purpose of maintaining bee colonies. 
The Beekeeping guide will work on measurement of the parameter’s below collected on an interval and entered into a Django Python web interface and will return results showing the status of the man-made hive
# Measurements will include:
*	Audio Recordings
*	Hive Temperature
*	Temperature Accuracy
*	Hive Humidity
*	Humidity Accuracy
*	External Temperature
*	External Humidity
*	Atmospheric Pressure
*	Wind Speed
